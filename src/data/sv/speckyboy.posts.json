        "rendered": "<p>It used to be that if you wanted to create a web directory you had to invest a lot of time and money into a custom designed website built from the ground up. Not to mention the cost to maintain and upgrade your website as your directory grew.<\/p>\n<p>And if you had no prior experience in web development, chances are you had to employ a web developer to help you with all of this, only adding to the cost of building a web directory website.<\/p>\n<p>But all of that has changed thanks to the amount of web directory solutions that have hit the market designed to help WordPress website owners create their own, unique directories. No longer are people required to rely on outdated and difficult to manage directory software of the early nineties that offer very little by way of customization and extendibility.<\/p>\n<p>However, despite the number of WordPress directory solutions available today, and the ease they offer website owners looking to build and scale a web directory, it is still challenging to figure out which one is the right one for your own individual needs.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why today we are going to look at few of the very best web directory plugins and themes available for WordPress users today. We&#8217;ll take a look at each solution&#8217;s top features, as well as some disadvantages so that you can make the best decision for your web directory needs.<\/p>\n<h2>Top 3 WordPress Directory Themes<\/h2>\n<h3>1. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/themeforest.net\/item\/listingpro-multipurpose-directory-theme\/19386460\">ListingPro<\/a><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img width=\"1000\" height=\"711\" alt=\"ListingPro WordPress Directory Plugin Theme\" src=\"https:\/\/speckyboy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/top-wordpress-directory-wordpress-themes-plugins-16.jpg\"\/><\/p>\n<p>ListingPro is a premium, all-in-one web directory solution that holds true to the philosophy, &#8220;No paid plugins needed.

It is designed to give Gravity Forms users a way to turn their existing WordPress website into a fully functioning web directory. It&#8217;s user-friendly and packed with most of the features needed to create a web directory of any kind. For example, create a business, restaurant, service provider, real estate, or even a job board directory.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img width=\"607\" height=\"784\" alt=\"Listify WordPress Directory Plugin Theme\" src=\"https:\/\/speckyboy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/top-wordpress-directory-wordpress-themes-plugins-3.png\"\/><\/p>\n<p>To do so, simply create a Gravity Forms form on the frontend of your website asking users for all of the required information of a listing. Users will then fill out the form when they visit your website and submit it to you. From there, you will click a few buttons on the backend of your site and turn the form information into a directory listing to be displayed on the frontend of your website.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img width=\"663\" height=\"676\" alt=\"Listify WordPress Directory Plugin Theme\" src=\"https:\/\/speckyboy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/top-wordpress-directory-wordpress-themes-plugins-22.png\"\/><\/p>\n<p>Display these shortcode generated listings anywhere on your website, and rest assured that they will render seamlessly for all site visitors regardless of the device they are accessing your website from.

    {
        "rendered": "<p>The ability to successfully manage multiple projects is part of being a freelance web designer. And, while outsiders may think it\u2019s a simple skill, it turns out to be incredibly difficult. It seems that no matter how organized you are a carefully-planned schedule can turn to dust before you can say \u201cnext\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>The truth is that scheduling design projects is not like serving customers in line at the grocery store. Designers can\u2019t simply take care of one client at a time exclusively. Instead, it\u2019s more like an ice cream truck that is overwhelmed by hungry kids on a summer day. In other words: It can be complete chaos.<\/p>\n<p>So how do you control the crowd? How do you deal with projects that unexpectedly run long and overlap others? Let\u2019s try and make some sense of this mess!<\/p>\n<h2>Websites Aren\u2019t Cars<\/h2>\n<p>The first thing freelance designers need to realize is that building a website isn\u2019t like building a car or any other mass-produced product. Automobiles benefit from an assembly line of workers and robots that carry out specific <a href=\"https:\/\/speckyboy.com\/task-management\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tasks<\/a>. Therefore, a company can know exactly how long it takes to build each car.<\/p>\n<p>Websites, on the other hand, aren\u2019t so cut-and-dry. Besides the fact that most of us don\u2019t have an assembly line on our side, each website we build is at least somewhat unique. Sure, things like themes, plugins and <a href=\"https:\/\/speckyboy.com\/responsive-lightweight-css-frameworks\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">frameworks<\/a> can help to speed up the process. But a website is still a one-off kind of product.<\/p>\n<p>This means that projects are inevitably going to run longer than we expect. Sometimes it\u2019s because of a bug we can\u2019t seem to squash or a client that keeps changing their mind. It can also be that the client is slow in getting us the resources we need to finish things off. When you think about it, there are a number of things that can cause a project to drag on. It\u2019s actually amazing that we get anything done at all.<\/p>\n<p>Knowing this helps us come to terms with the fact that web design is a fluid process that can change at any moment. So we shouldn\u2019t be too surprised when a project runs long or that we all-of-the-sudden hear from that client who\u2019s in a <a href=\"https:\/\/speckyboy.com\/dealing-hurry-wait-design-client\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hurry<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>There are certain things we can\u2019t control. That means we have to accept some level of flexibility in our schedules.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/speckyboy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/designer-schedule-02.jpg\" alt=\"Factory worker welding.\" width=\"850\" height=\"400\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>It\u2019s About Expectations<\/h2>\n<p>Now that we understand the predictably unpredictable ways of freelance life, we can have a better grip on how we do things. We can build in some extra wiggle-room when scheduling projects \u2013 preparing for the worst-case scenario.<\/p>\n<p>But that\u2019s only half the battle. Clients are thinking about their own challenges and may not have much of an idea about the ones you\u2019re facing. All they know is that they need their website as soon as possible.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to set the level of client expectations from the very beginning of the process. We need an open and honest line of communication about what we can and can\u2019t do, along with a realistic timeline for getting it done. It\u2019s also worth noting that any delay on their part can throw a major monkey wrench in your schedule, as well. Working together is a two-way street, after all.<\/p>\n<p>This discussion can be difficult, as we want to make sure that everyone\u2019s happy and well taken care of. You never want to disappoint a client. From my own experience, I\u2019ve tended to stress myself out over having multiple projects that seem to collide simultaneously. But things are far better when I can get a little breathing room regarding deadlines. The only way to achieve this is through communication.<\/p>\n<p>Then there\u2019s also the risk of <a href=\"https:\/\/speckyboy.com\/fear-of-missing-out-on-projects\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">missing out<\/a> on a potential project because we can\u2019t reasonably meet someone\u2019s desired timeline. Not everyone will be empathic of your schedule, but that\u2019s okay. Offer as much flexibility as you can. If a client can\u2019t accept your terms, then maybe moving on is for the best. Still, you\u2019ll find that most people really are understanding and are willing to work with you.<\/p>\n<p>In the end, all you can do is provide an honest assessment of your schedule. More times than not, that should help to quell some of the chaos.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/speckyboy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/designer-schedule-01.jpg\" alt=\"A web designer's complicated schedule.\" width=\"850\" height=\"400\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Write it in Pencil<\/h2>\n<p>I admit that I\u2019m the type of person who hates unexpected changes to a schedule. When things don\u2019t go the way I\u2019ve anticipated, it\u2019s incredibly frustrating.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, that\u2019s the way the world works \u2013 whether any of us like it or not. No matter where we work or who we work with, things are always subject to change. So it\u2019s best to take this into account when scheduling projects.<\/p>\n<p>So, rather than have a dyed-in-the-wool schedule mapped out, it might be best to write it down in pencil (or erasable marker). Anticipate that not everything will go exactly as planned and that there will always be issues that pop up unexpectedly.<\/p>\n<p>The bright side of it all is that, even though we can\u2019t bring absolute certainty to our schedules, there are things we can do to alleviate the worst stressors. Have policies in place and make sure that clients are aware of them.<\/p>\n<p>The other key element is to understand that <a href=\"https:\/\/speckyboy.com\/survive-web-designer-business-background\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">running a web design business<\/a> is different than your typical 9-5 job. That will help you cope when your plans inevitably turn to dust.<\/p>\n",

Figuring out what\u2019s slowing you down is hard enough. Harder still is that some methods for increasing speed (caching plugins, for instance) are full of cryptic settings.<\/p>\n<p>It can all add up to something of a nightmare in diagnosing and fixing what would seem to be a simple problem.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s where we\u2019ve come in to help. There are tools out there to help simplify the process of satisfying your need for (WordPress) speed. Below, we\u2019ve compiled a list of plugins that don\u2019t require any sort of rocket science degree. They will, however, help you build a blazing-fast site. Plus, we\u2019ll offer tips for getting the most performance out of your WordPress website.<\/p>\n<h2>WordPress Optimization Plugins<\/h2>\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/wp-rocket.me\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WP Rocket<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>Setting up a WordPress cache plugin can be an incredibly frustrating experience. There are often so many settings with not-so-obvious names that you really have to do a lot of testing to find out what something does.<\/p>\n<p><strong>WP Rocket<\/strong> is a premium plugin, but it may just be worth the price. It features an ultra-minimal setup and really does <a href=\"https:\/\/wpdevshed.com\/best-wordpress-cache-plugin\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">speed up your site<\/a>. The package includes page caching, preloading, database optimization and lazy loading of images.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/speckyboy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/simple-tools-to-speed-wp-01.png\" alt=\"WP Rocket\" width=\"750\" height=\"350\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/fast-velocity-minify\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fast Velocity Minify<\/a><\/h3>\n<p><strong>Fast Velocity Minify<\/strong> will take your site\u2019s CSS and JS files and combine them into smaller file groups. After all, each one of these files can be thousands of lines long.<\/p>\n<p>Compressing and combining things can really cut down on load time. This is especially true for sites running lots of plugins. The setup is quite easy, with the default settings getting the job done. There are also advanced options available if you\u2019re feeling adventurous.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/speckyboy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/simple-tools-to-speed-wp-02.jpg\" alt=\"Fast Velocity Minify\" width=\"750\" height=\"350\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/bj-lazy-load\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BJ Lazy Load<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>Lazy loading content can be a big help in cutting down on server requests. <strong>BJ Lazy Load<\/strong> works by only loading images, text widgets and iframe content (like YouTube videos, for example) when they are within the user\u2019s viewport.<\/p>\n<p>That way, heavy content only gets loaded in when needed. This is especially nice for long-scrolling pages that feature lots of multimedia. Just turn it on and see the difference.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/speckyboy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/simple-tools-to-speed-wp-03.jpg\" alt=\"BJ Lazy Load\" width=\"750\" height=\"350\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/autoptimize\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Autoptimize<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>With just a few clicks, <strong>Autoptimize<\/strong> will concatenate styles and scripts, minify HTML, CSS and JS files, add expiry headers and cache them. The plugin can also move styles to your site\u2019s header and scripts to your site\u2019s footer, if desired.<\/p>\n<p>While the developer recommends using Autoptimize in conjunction with a caching plugin, it\u2019s still a simple way to speed up your site by itself.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/speckyboy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/simple-tools-to-speed-wp-04.jpg\" alt=\"Autoptimize\" width=\"750\" height=\"350\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/speed-booster-pack\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Speed Booster Pack<\/a><\/h3>\n<p><strong>Speed Booster Pack<\/strong> utilizes several techniques to speed up your site. It minifies HTML\/JavaScript\/CSS, but also does so much more. For example, it will compress images, load JS libraries from Google\u2019s servers (rather than from your own server), defer the parsing of scripts, remove \u2018junk\u2019 headers and other tweaks.<\/p>\n<p>Inside the plugin settings, peak memory usage and page load times are displayed. Just check the boxes next to each option you want to enable. You also have the option of disabling specific scripts from being minified.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/speckyboy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/simple-tools-to-speed-wp-05.jpg\" alt=\"Speed Booster Pack\" width=\"750\" height=\"350\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/rvg-optimize-database\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Optimize Database after Deleting Revisions<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>Your site\u2019s database can become incredibly cluttered over time. That can lead to sluggish performance. <strong>Optimize Database after Deleting Revisions<\/strong> aims to be a \u201cone click\u201d solution by deleting post revisions (you can keep a specified amount of revisions per post, if desired), spam comments, unused tags, pingbacks\/trackbacks and orphan postmeta items.<\/p>\n<p>It also optimizes database tables to help keep your DB lean and clean. Optimizations can be set to run hourly, once daily, twice daily or weekly. It\u2019s compatible with WordPress multisite.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/speckyboy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/simple-tools-to-speed-wp-06.jpg\" alt=\"Optimize Database after Deleting Revisions\" width=\"750\" height=\"350\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Tips for Increasing Speed<\/h2>\n<p>WordPress, by itself, is not a slow platform. But as we add components like <a href=\"https:\/\/speckyboy.com\/50-beautiful-and-free-wordpress-themes\/\">themes<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/speckyboy.com\/category\/wordpress-plugins\/\">plugins<\/a>, it can get weighed down. Combined with database clutter and potential hosting issues, a site can really slow to a crawl.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few things to take into account when you\u2019re looking to increase speed:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Avoid Heavy Themes<\/strong><br \/>\nJust because a theme calls itself \u201cminimal\u201d doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s lightweight. A theme may sport a minimalist look but still load a ton of scripts that will slow you down.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re using a third-party theme, check the documentation to see how to disable scripts you don\u2019t plan to use. Otherwise, use a lightweight <a href=\"https:\/\/speckyboy.com\/wordpress-theme-frameworks\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">starter theme<\/a> and build for what you need.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do You Really Need that Plugin?<\/strong><br \/>\nEach plugin you install and activate can add scripts, styles and database entries. Before you install a plugin, do some research to see if it\u2019s known to cause any issues with load times. Ask yourself if it\u2019s really a necessity for the success and <a href=\"https:\/\/speckyboy.com\/10-free-plugins-secure-wordpress-website\/\">security of your site<\/a>. If not, you may want to move on for the time being.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Make Note of Remote Scripts and Styles<\/strong><br \/>\nServices that provide web fonts, analytics or ad-serving capabilities can have an effect on speed. While these providers may have fast remote servers, any sort of connection issue can grind page loading to a halt. Be aware of what services you\u2019re using and only use those that are necessary. For that matter, it\u2019s also a good idea to stick with well-known and trusted providers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Watch for Missing Content<\/strong><br \/>\nWhether local or remote, look out for any scripts or stylesheets that fail to load. A missing file can cause your site to react incredibly slowly, along with possible display and functionality consequences. Use a tool like <a href=\"https:\/\/tools.pingdom.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pingdom<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/gtmetrix.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GTmetrix<\/a> to analyze your site. Both tools offer a \u201cwaterfall\u201d view that shows how long it takes for each file to load along with your page. If one of these files generates a 404 error, you\u2019ve found the culprit.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Be Aware of Hosting Limitations<\/strong><br \/>\nNot all web hosts are created equal. Some just flat-out provide a better product. But you should also be aware of some hosting-related issues that can cause a slowdown. Being on an overcrowded server, running a non-supported (old) version of PHP or having too much traffic on a shared hosting account can all cause problems.<\/p>\n<h2>Getting up to Speed<\/h2>\n<p>Bringing your WordPress site up to light speed doesn\u2019t have to be overly difficult. Using the tools and techniques above, you\u2019ll have everything you need to make improvements.<\/p>\n<p>Speed is vitally important, after all. It affects things like SEO and your bounce rate. So it\u2019s worth the little bit of effort to squeeze as much performance out of your website as you can.<\/p>\n",

This is especially true for UX designers as user experience is a design area that features some truly unique challenges.<\/p>\n<p>Do UX design and the high salaries that go with it appeal to you? If yes, things will be much easier for you if you have the right tools and understand what they can do, and why they do it.<\/p>\n<p>These tools include a wide range of products. From prototyping and interactive design to team collaboration and user testing. Some UX tools focus on specific tasks. Others are all-encompassing.<\/p>\n<p>There is a sheer number of UI\/UX tools on the market. This can make searching for the best ones an overwhelming experience. We&#8217;ve done the searching for you. 7 top tools have been selected for this post, any one of which can make your design work a whole lot easier.<\/p>\n<h2>1. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.trymason.com\/?utm_source=speckyboy.com&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=best-ux-tools\">Mason<\/a><\/h2>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.trymason.com\/?utm_source=speckyboy.com&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=best-ux-tools\"><img src=\"https:\/\/speckyboy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/ui-ux-tools-2018-01.png\" alt=\"UI UX Tools 2018 Web Design User Experience Mason\" height=\"400\" width=\"1000\"\/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Designing mockups and prototypes to share with team members or to hand off to developers is one approach to website and app design, and a popular one at that.<\/p>\n<p>Mason has a better idea, though. Using the Mason platform, you design software and digital features using a simple visual interface. Your designs, as you see them in the builder, can be deployed directly into production with pixel-perfect accuracy. No more handing off a prototype only to have the &#8220;real thing&#8221; miss the mark. What you build, you see, in real-time.<\/p>\n<p>As useful as mockups and prototypes can often be, they represent overhead costs, not to mention the time it takes to build them. QA inspection is also required to verify that prototype features and functions along with those described in the design documentation, have been scrupulously adhered to during production. With Mason, the QA inspection process is not necessary and can therefore be bypassed, saving even more time and money.<\/p>\n<p>Mason is different, perhaps even radical, but you will easily and quickly become accustomed to its straightforward approach to digital design.<\/p>\n<h2>2. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/overflow.io\/?utm_source=baw_media_speckyboy&amp;utm_medium=article_2nd_slot&amp;utm_campaign=early_beta&amp;utm_content=top_ui_ux_tools_2018\">Overflow<\/a><\/h2>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/overflow.io\/?utm_source=baw_media_speckyboy&amp;utm_medium=article_2nd_slot&amp;utm_campaign=early_beta&amp;utm_content=top_ui_ux_tools_2018\"><img src=\"https:\/\/speckyboy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/ui-ux-tools-2018-02.jpg\" alt=\"UI UX Tools 2018 Web Design User Experience Overflow\" height=\"415\" width=\"1000\"\/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>User flow diagramming is a must part of the product design cycle, but is often skipped. Why? Because the entire user flow diagramming process is fragmented, taking too long to complete as it involves many disconnected tools and a lot of manual work. A process that becomes even more exhausting for designers when they want to keep their design flows in sync with their design changes.<\/p>\n<p>But here comes a new tool to the rescue. Overflow, the first-ever user flow diagramming tool created specifically for designers. As a powerful cross-platform tool that integrates seamlessly with the most popular design tools, it helps designers quickly turn their designs into playable user flow diagrams. This way, designers can effectively communicate their work, while fully engaging their audience with an interactive user flow presentation.<\/p>\n<p>With Overflow, designers can design, present, share &amp; print their user flows to get valuable feedback, all in one place. Overflow is currently available in private beta.

        "rendered": "<p>WordPress provides you with a decent head start when it comes to creating accessible websites. For example, recent default themes like Twenty Seventeen are already built with <a href=\"https:\/\/speckyboy.com\/web-accessibility-101\/\">accessibility in mind<\/a>. But that doesn\u2019t mean that your work is done.<\/p>\n<p>There are still plenty of items to check off your list to ensure that everyone has access to your site\u2019s navigation and content. Thankfully, this is one of the areas where the plugin development community has really stepped up. We now have access to a wide selection of tools to help us meet the challenges that come along with accessibility.<\/p>\n<p>Here is a collection of WordPress plugins that can help improve your site\u2019s accessibility:<\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/wp-accessibility\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WP Accessibility<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>WP Accessibility (authored by Joe Dolson, who we recently <a href=\"https:\/\/speckyboy.com\/web-design-challenges-accessibility\/\" rel=\"noopener\">interviewed<\/a>) is a multi-function plugin that solves common accessibility issues.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s most outward feature is a font size and color contract toolbar that helps users more easily read your content. But it also does a lot of behind-the-scenes work like adding skip-to-content links, implementing an outline to the link <code>:focus<\/code> state for better keyboard navigation, utilizing <code>longdesc<\/code> for images and a whole lot more. Each feature can be turned on or off through a settings page.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/speckyboy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/wordpress-accessibility-01.png\" alt=\"WP Accessibility\" width=\"750\" height=\"350\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/wp-accessibility-helper\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WP Accessibility Helper<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>WP Accessibility Helper adds a user-friendly toolbar to your site that lets users select different color contrasts (they can choose from a selection of color schemes) and adjust font size to their liking. But it goes above and beyond with user options for underlining or highlighting links, grayscale images, changing fonts and keyboard navigation.<\/p>\n<p>The plugin also boasts a DOM scanner that will check your site for various accessibility errors. There\u2019s also a <a href=\"https:\/\/accessibility-helper.co.il\/features-comparison\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pro version<\/a> that adds even more goodies.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/speckyboy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/wordpress-accessibility-02.png\" alt=\"WP Accessibility Helper\" width=\"750\" height=\"350\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/accessibility-widget\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Accessibility Widget<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>If you just want a simple way to enable users to enlarge text, Accessibility Widget is a nice option. It\u2019s a minimally-styled widget that offers up \u201cSmall\u201d, \u201cMedium\u201d and \u201cLarge\u201d text links. Settings let you determine which HTML elements are affected and how big (or small) fonts should be.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/speckyboy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/wordpress-accessibility-03.jpg\" alt=\"Accessibility Widget\" width=\"750\" height=\"350\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/accessible-poetry\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Accessible Poetry<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>Accessible Poetry adds a floating button that, when clicked, exposes a toolbar to allow for font and contrast changes. You can also zoom in and out of the page, along with mark links and disable onscreen flashes. But the star of the show is its ALT Platform area inside the WordPress Dashboard. This screen will list any images uploaded to your site that don\u2019t have an ALT tag assigned. Even better, you can set a tag for each image directly from this listing.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/speckyboy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/wordpress-accessibility-04.jpg\" alt=\"Accessible Poetry\" width=\"750\" height=\"350\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/contact-form-7-accessible-defaults\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contact Form 7: Accessible Defaults<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>Another creation from Joe Dolson, Contact Form 7: Accessible Defaults will provide an accessible starting point for those of you using Contact Form 7.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s an important tool because Contact Form 7 isn\u2019t so accessible by default. The plugin adds a selection of accessible form types to use as the basis for your new form. Note that it doesn\u2019t affect pre-existing forms \u2013 just new ones. For existing forms, you\u2019ll have to recreate them using the new templates. That\u2019s why it\u2019s recommended that you install this companion plugin on your site at the same time as Contact Form 7.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/speckyboy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/wordpress-accessibility-05.jpg\" alt=\"Contact Form 7: Accessible Defaults\" width=\"750\" height=\"350\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/gravity-forms-wcag-20-form-fields\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WCAG 2.0 form fields for Gravity Forms<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>WCAG 2.0 form fields for Gravity Forms adds some accessibility-friendly features to Gravity Forms. For instance, it will wrap checkboxes and radio fields in a <code>fieldset<\/code>.<\/p>\n<p>It also makes improvements to the input error notice that users receive, displaying the actual number of errors made. In addition, the plugin adds <a href=\"https:\/\/www.w3.org\/WAI\/intro\/aria\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ARIA<\/a> attributes to various fields along with other behind-the-scenes tweaks.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/speckyboy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/wordpress-accessibility-08.png\" alt=\"WCAG 2.0 form fields for Gravity Forms\" width=\"750\" height=\"350\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/wa11y\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wA11y \u2013 The Web Accessibility Toolbox<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>wA11y provides a connection to popular accessibility tools that will analyze your site. The first tool is called <a href=\"http:\/\/khan.github.io\/tota11y\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tota11y<\/a> and is provided by Khan Academy.<\/p>\n<p>It will annotate all the elements of a web page and point out any issues. The other tool is <a href=\"https:\/\/webaim.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WAVE<\/a>, which will provide you with a detailed accessibility analysis of the current page. Each tool will have its own button displayed on the bottom of your site to logged in users (you can choose which user roles will see the buttons). Just click the button of your choice to start analyzing.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/speckyboy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/wordpress-accessibility-06.png\" alt=\"wA11y \u2013 The Web Accessibility Toolbox\" width=\"750\" height=\"350\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/codecanyon.net\/item\/texttospeech-phpjs-script-converter\/8070020\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Text-To-Speech PHP\/JS Script Converter<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>Text-To-Speech PHP\/JS Script Converter is a commercial plugin that provides a way to convert text into spoken language (many different \u201cvoices\u201d are included). It\u2019s multilingual, with support for 44 languages and doesn\u2019t require any sort of additional framework to function.<\/p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t automated, however. You\u2019ll need to add some code to HTML wrapper elements for any items you want to enable text-to-speech capabilities. Still, this could be useful in the right circumstance.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/speckyboy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/wordpress-accessibility-07.jpg\" alt=\"Text-To-Speech PHP\/JS Script Converter\" width=\"750\" height=\"350\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/accessible-divi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Divi Accessibility<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re among the many users of the Divi theme, you may want to consider adding Divi Accessibility as well. It adds ARIA attributes, improves keyboard navigation of various elements and integrates the aforementioned tota11y into the package. This could be a big help in counteracting any accessibility shortcomings within this theme.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/speckyboy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/wordpress-accessibility-09.jpg\" alt=\"Divi Accessibility\" width=\"750\" height=\"350\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/wp-user-stylesheet-switcher\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WP User Stylesheet Switcher<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>WP User Stylesheet Switcher isn\u2019t necessarily an accessibility plugin, but it can be used in a way that does improve access. If the accessible solution for your site is to provide an alternate layout such as a text-only version, this plugin can make the task much easier.<\/p>\n<p>You can provide as many different stylesheets as you\u2019d like and users will be able to easily switch between them. When you think about it, this may be the simplest solution out there.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/speckyboy.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/wordpress-accessibility-10.png\" alt=\"WP User Stylesheet Switcher\" width=\"750\" height=\"350\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Leave No User Behind<\/h2>\n<p>The past few years have brought great awareness to the importance of creating an accessible website. While the process of ensuring you\u2019ve covered all your bases takes time, it\u2019s very much worth the extra effort. Using the tools profiled above are a great way to add features (visible or not) that will help every user get the most out of your WordPress site.<\/p>\n",
